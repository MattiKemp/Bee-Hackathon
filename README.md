# Project Story Writeup

## Inspiration
Inspired by the countless small-time games that we've enjoyed for years. Breaking through into the web-space for the first time, and learning a ton about the space.
Part of the fight against plastics and hoping to raise awareness of their dangers as well as the terrifying growth rate.

## What it does
Full-functioning website with information about the issues that we are trying to combat with this project.

Contains a game that allows you to play as a sea-creature, dealing with the day-to-day toil of not knowing what food is and what plastic is. This is a battle for life and death in the ocean, and we hope to model a little bit of that here. We directly use data collected by (referneced in Information page) to determine the growth rate of macroplastics in the ocean. This can provide both entertainment, and, what we hope, an increased awareness about the difficulties such an intense grwoth of plastic waste leads to.


## How we built it
Our application is built on the Python Flask microframework, using the Bootstrap CSS Library. Most of the website is pure HTML/CSS/Javascript. Playing the game utilizes the tie between these formats and allows for a smooth, educational experience.

This is hosted on a personal linux machine using nginx and gunicorn.

## Challenges we ran into

One of the largest challenges that we ran-into was hosting. From the get-go, we knew that we'd want this website to be able to be publically viewed. However, we didn't entirely realize what that entailed when attempting to host locally. Thankfully, one of our members was able to setup hosting with some coffee & lots of time. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're proud that for the majority of us, this is our first foray into web-programming. 

In addtion, when encountering Javascript and CSS for the first time, the process was surprisingly easy to follow and the results were truly satisfying. We are proud of our ability to make our front end look border line professional, along with our successful implementation with the back end and its necessary features.

## What we learned

We gained an appreciation for the challenges and benefits to web-development. We learned how to create, improve, and host our own dynamic webpages. Along with the challenges faced, we as a team have learned how to efficiently cooperate and progress towards a common goal. Finally, we gained the confidence that we can create a full-scale project like this quite quickly!

## What's next for Water.io

There are a TON of features that we didn't have time to add. Being forced to prioritize some technical tasks is required, but here are some of the things that we have yet to get to.
Clearer UI/UX
Better web hosting :(
